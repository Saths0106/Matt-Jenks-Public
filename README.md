# Matt-Jenks-Public

# This Repository is for potential employers to view what I have worked on during my classes and understand where I am as a programmer but since it is public some of the code I have worked on will not be available here. If you want additional coding samples please let me know, I can provide some code from projects I've been working on in my free time.
